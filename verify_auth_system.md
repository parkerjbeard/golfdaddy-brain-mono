# Authentication System Verification

## Summary
The authentication system has been successfully implemented and tested. The system uses a hybrid approach:
- **Supabase** for authentication (login/logout)
- **PostgreSQL** for user profiles and role management

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Created `users` table with role-based access control
- Supports three roles: `employee`, `manager`, `admin`
- Test users created:
  - test@example.com (employee)
  - manager@example.com (manager)
  - admin@example.com (admin)

### 2. Backend Integration
- Fixed auth endpoints to work with both Supabase tokens and local database
- Created development endpoints for role management (`/dev/sync-current-user/{role}`)
- Temporarily disabled API key authentication to allow testing

### 3. Frontend Components
- **DevRoleSelector**: A development tool that appears in the bottom-right corner
  - Shows current user role
  - Allows switching between employee/manager/admin roles
  - Automatically refreshes the page after role change
- **AuthContext**: Updated to handle API calls with proper error handling
- **AppSidebar**: Navigation that respects role-based access

### 4. Role-Based Navigation
- **Company Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Accessible to all roles
- **Manager Dashboard** (`/manager`): Accessible to managers and admins only
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): Accessible to admins only

## Testing the System

1. **Frontend is running on**: http://localhost:8081
2. **Backend is running on**: http://localhost:8000

To test role switching:
1. Log in to the application
2. Look for the "Dev: Role Selector" widget in the bottom-right corner
3. Click on different role buttons to switch roles
4. The page will refresh and navigation options will update based on the new role

## Pending Tasks
1. Re-enable API authentication (currently disabled for testing)
2. Implement proper Supabase user synchronization
3. Add production-ready role management UI
4. Remove development-only endpoints and components

## Configuration
The system is configured via environment variables:
- `USE_LOCAL_DB=true` - Uses PostgreSQL instead of Supabase for user data
- `ENABLE_API_AUTH=false` - API key authentication disabled for testing
- Development endpoints only available when `ENVIRONMENT=development`
