*"Special thanks to Hyram for breaking the limits of Cursor usage this week (I 5'xed the limits thereafter). Let's use it more. Great idea from Leandro to create a channel dedicated to helping the team learn how to use AI for coding. Anyone want a general how to use AI channel? Great job to those who are following suit with AI adoption."*
