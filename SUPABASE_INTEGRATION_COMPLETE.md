# Supabase Integration Complete

## Overview
The application is now fully integrated with your existing Supabase users table, preserving all existing data including AI analysis hours and other fields.

## Key Points
- **No hardcoded values**: All user data comes from your real Supabase database
- **Existing data preserved**: Your users table with all its fields remains intact
- **Role-based access**: Works with your existing role structure (ADMIN, MANAGER, employee)
- **Real-time updates**: Changes to roles are immediately reflected in Supabase

## Configuration
The backend is configured with:
```yaml
USE_LOCAL_DB: false
SUPABASE_URL: https://xfnxafbsmqowzvuwmhvi.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY: [your-service-key]
```

## Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via Supabase Auth
2. Backend validates JWT token with Supabase
3. User profile is fetched from Supabase users table
4. Role-based navigation is enforced based on user's role

## API Endpoints
- `GET /auth/me` - Returns current user from Supabase
- `GET /api/v1/users` - Returns all users from Supabase
- `POST /dev/sync-current-user/{role}` - Updates user role in Supabase (dev only)

## Your Users
The system is using your existing users:
- parkerjohnsonbeard@gmail.com (ADMIN)
- testadmin1@example.com (ADMIN) 
- testmanager1@example.com (MANAGER)
- testuser1@example.com (employee)
- And any other users in your Supabase database

All functionality including employee management, role switching, and navigation now works with real Supabase data.
